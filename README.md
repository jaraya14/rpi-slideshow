Setup Raspberry Pi to display photo slideshow from SMB

10,000 ft view:

1) Run a slideshow from a network folder.
2) Automatically update new pictures as they added in the network folder.
3) Run without intervention.
4) Loop pictures


Ideas to investigate:

1) Samba server
2) Use XBMC for slideshow mount pictures to SMB
3) Can it display animated GIFs?
